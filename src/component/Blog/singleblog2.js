                  <p>Playing cricket where when the batsman hardly needs to hit the ball. He touches it with two of his
fingers and the ball floats off. The fielder, floats towards the ball to catch it. Yeah, an imaginary
world. Gravity keeps us grounded here on earth. But what about living in outer space? Is it possible?
When? And how?</p>
<p>The sole reason we are thinking about an outer space settlement is to survive and thrive. We living
things want to grow and expand. We are very well aware of the threats we are going to face due to
the level of climate change that has happened. Global warming might end up the civilization which
was about to happen after nearly 5 billion years later due to the red-giant stage of our sun. Another
key advantage of space settlement is the ability to build new land, rather than take it from someone
else. This allows a thriving, expansive civilization without war or destruction of Earth&#39;s biosphere.</p>

<p>Once possible, it is absolutely certain that anyone would be able to live in that new home. As of now,
only trained astronauts are sent up there in the International Space Station, which is a space abode
orbiting our earth. Once a proper settlement plan is laid, every commoner can start a new life up
there. Zero gravity will help the handicapped get rid of their wheelchairs and live a normal floaty life.
We might be able to start a bigger civilization than we have here on earth.</p>
<p>The earth is in the goldilocks zone in our solar system. So, any craft, acting as our home should be
near about the equator of the earth. It would be orbiting and rotating to maintain a pseudo-gravity.
Arrangements must be air-tight to maintain a breathable and survivable atmosphere. It will require
an independent biosphere which must be recycled continuously.</p>

<p>All this while, we have been talking about a craft which will serve the purpose of our new home. But
why not a planet? Or a moon? Well, a spacecraft is a better option in several ways. Firstly, hunting
for a planet as suitable as the earth for human survival is a tedious task. Secondly, travelling to a
planet we might find light years away has its own perks.  Early settlements in Earth orbit will be only
hours away. This is a massive logistical advantage. For a long-term settlement, crafts will serve a
much better purpose than any planet or moon. free-space settlements can rotate to provide any g
level desired, although it is not true gravity. Spinning the settlement will create a force called
pseudo-gravity, that will feel a lot like gravity. As free-space settlement will turn, the inside of the
hull will push on the inhabitants forcing them to go around.  Solar power will be available nearly
24/7. These facilities might be enough to convince you that space crafts will be the best option for
space settlement.</p>
<p>The toughest task to achieve in the space settlement development tent are launch, construction,
and life support. Launch is expensive today because most vehicles, after a single flight are thrown
away. The keys to reusability are technology and launch rate. There are multiple efforts in progress
to develop reusable rocket technology but today&#39;s flight rate, like SpaceX Falcon9. A single reusable
vehicle that could fly twice a week will be able to meet that demand of a high launch rate. The
application of space solar power, and the right price, has the potential to launch multiple vehicles.</p>
<p>Although building space settlements will be exceedingly difficult, it is not impossible particularly if
we start small and close to Earth. Small settlements in Low Earth Orbit directly above the equator
would be much simpler, and much easier to build. Cosmic rays and solar flares create a lethal radiation environment in space but settlements in Equatorial Low Earth Orbit (ELEO) will be
protected from most space radiation by the Earth and Earth&#39;s magnetic field. Solar energy is the
most abundant, reliable and is commonly used to power satellites today. Massive structures will be
converting sunlight into large amounts of electrical power for settlement use. Energy may also be an
export item for space settlements, using microwave beams to send power to Earth.</p>

<p>It will take decades for this dream to turn into reality as Rome was not built in a day. But it will be
worth the wait. The view of our earth from our new home will be breath-taking. We will get a new
outlook to space. Till then we can visit the Cooper planet in the movie Interstellar whenever we
want. Probably get ideas of what it would be like…living in a floating spaceship.</p>
